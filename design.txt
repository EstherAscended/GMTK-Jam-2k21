JITTS is split into several levels. In each level, the player is presented with a rail network with trains, resource hubs and stations to drop off resources. The objective of each level is to guide the trains to the appropriate resources hubs and drop off the resources at their appropriate stations, all within a specified time limit.

Trains move at a fixed speed and cannot be stopped. If two trains collide with each other the player loses and must restart the level. In each rail network there are a number of junctions which the player may flip or rotate to safely guide the trains. When a train passes a resource hub, a carriage filled with the corresponding resource is attached to the train. A train accumulating carriages also causes its hitbox to increase in size. When a train with the corresponding resource passes a resource hub, its carriages disappear into the station. Trains DON'T disappear after delivering their resources.

Trains may start the level with any number of carriages pre-filled with resources.
There are several types of resources: coal, oil, wood, steel, gems, passengers, gold, etc.
Each resource hub can only give out to trains a certain amount of resources (enough for all stations to receive their required amount)

When all stations have received their required allotment of resources, the level finishes and the player wins.
For each level there is also a time limit; if ever the player runs out of time, they lose the level. When the player wins the level, they receive 1-3 'gold stars' depending on how much time they have remaining.

POSSIBLE/FUTURE FEATURES:
Each train can only hold a maximum number of carriages?
Each resource has a unique mechanic?
Trains can only drop off the last attached carriage?
Gold stars unlock later levels?
Delivering resources can change the level (e.g. delivering electricity allows the use of additional junctions)
